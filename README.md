# Advent of Code 2022

I'm doing this year's [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2022) to learn Rust!

This repo holds all of the working solutions to each day's challenge, with the appropriate inputs.

Comments will probably be sparse - hopefully my code becomes more readable and less "dumb" as the challenge progresses.
